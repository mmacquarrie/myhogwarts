A course registration system for my Database Driven Websitesâ€™ final project.

## Basic How-To's
Add prerequisites to a course from course > view.
Add past courses to a student from student > view.
Register students from register > select a student.
Deregister students on the class page.

## Notes
* You can only add a prerequisite to a course if it's in the same subject and the number of the intended prerequisite comes before the course. For example, POTION-101 can be a prerequisite for POTION-201, but POTION-211 and TRNSF-101 cannot.
* You can only register a student for a class if they have completed the prerequisites or there are none. Classes they are not eligible for will not appear in registration.
* A student can have whichever past courses you please. In an actual registration system this would be based on previous registrations, which are restricted as described above, but for ease of use they are not restricted here.
